**LATE POLICY:** You have a total of **4** late days that can be used 
in atomic units over the entire quarter. By "atomic" I mean, for example, 
that 35 mins over the deadline is equal to 1 late day.

## Haskell Installation Guide

COMING SOON

<!-- Here's what you need to install for a completely local environment:
- install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) if you're on Windows, and [here are instructions for using it with vscode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode). Haskell can run on Windows, but it can have really weird issues sometimes, WSL is a much more pleasant experience. (If you have an old subsystem, WSL1 might have issues, you may need to update to WSL2)
- install `stack` from a package manager like `apt` (`sudo apt install haskell-stack`) or `brew`, or from [the stack website](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) if you don't have a package manager.
- install `nasm` and `clang` for compilation (without these, running `make` will have errors saying that it couldn't find one of these programs), these should also be in package managers.
- Optionally, install IDE extensions like the VSCode `Haskell` extension for syntax highlighting/hover/more

With all this installed, you should have a local setup that seamlessly works with the PAs, just open up your IDE and run `make`. -->

## Virtual Machine

Those of you having trouble installing the Haskell tool chain 
can use the CSE 230 VM (COMING SOON).
