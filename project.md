title: Final Project

---

You will do the project in a  **in a group of 4** over 
the *second half* of the quarter and will evaluate it 
with a demo during the final exam time block.

The project will comprise 30% of your overall grade. 

You are expected to spend at least **30 hours** (each) 
in the project. 

## Goals and Timeline

The goal of the project is to give you some hands on 
experience with building a realistic application using
the principles learned in CSE 230.

- **Friday 11/12** Proposal [Submit here](https://forms.gle/Fd4CUajSCzS4Er4e7)
- **Friday 11/25** Updates
- **12/10** Demonstration

The overall goal is for *you* to write an application 
from scratch, so we will provide very basic starter 
code, just containing the bare library dependencies.
You are free to use any existing open source libraries 
to build your application.

## Ideas

For the project you will implement any **line application** 
using [the `brick` library](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/).

You can think of any application you wish. If you think your idea 
is unrealistic, discuss it with the course staff. Of course, it 
should not be *any of* the projects already listed or implemented
by others, doing so or **any of plagiarism will result in 
a score of zero**.

Here are some ideas for you to get started

- A clone of the [`fish` shell](https://fishshell.com/) with history-based autocomplete
- An arcade game like `breakout` or `space invaders` 
- A networked two player game e.g., chess, checkers, scrabble etc. 
- A networked chat/irc/slack client
- A vim/editor clone, extended with support for shared editing
- A puzzle solver, e.g., sudoku.

Feel free to think of other applications!

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria: 

- *collaboration:* the project will be a public repo on [github](https://github.com/) and all members should contribute equally. 
- *library usage:* the project should use existing libraries of the [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) ecosystem.  
- *reproduction:* the project should be easily installed via [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) or [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
- *unit testing:* the project should pass unit tests that are implemented either manually or using [quickcheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck). 
- *presentation:* make sure to clearly present your goals and your implementation.

### Milestone 1: Registration and Proposal

1. Create a `github` repository for your project with a `README.md` 
   that describes your proposed application and its goals in 300 words.

2. Fill up a google form (to be shared) linking your project and team members.


### Milestone 2: Updates

Update your `README` with 

- What is the architecture of your application (the key components)?
- What challenges (if any) did you have so far and how did you solve them?
- Do you expect to meet your goals until the deadline?
- If not, how will you modify your goals? 

### Milestone 3: Demonstration

You will give a **10 min** demonstration of your project during an open
"poster session" to be conducted during the finals slot **Friday 12/10 from 11:30am -- 2:30pm**.
